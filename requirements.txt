# ComfyUI custom node â€” no extra pip dependencies required.
# Uses only Python stdlib and ComfyUI-bundled libraries (torch, numpy, pillow, safetensors, etc.).
# Leaving this file without packages avoids clobbering the ComfyUI environment.
# If you intend to run this module outside ComfyUI, you may need (uncomment as appropriate):
# numpy>=1.24
# pillow>=9.0
# torch>=2.1  # Do NOT include this when running under ComfyUI; ComfyUI manages torch.
